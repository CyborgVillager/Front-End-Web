# Front End Web
 This respo will be used for a front end web dev, and be a quick review/tutorial to help those that are interested in furthering increasing their skills in front end. Feel free to check the code & edit, you could learn a thing or two ^_*

After you have learned a bit about front end development, try to make a site using your new found knowledge! You can use my portfolio site as an example . Anyhow have a great day/night!
