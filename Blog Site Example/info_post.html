        <h2>The Perspective Of IT</h2>

        <p class="imp0">The term IT itself is very general, thereâ€™s many aspects of it that can be used for a various sorts
            of activities ranging from commercial, military, scientific, and consumer-based actions. Every technological
            advancement can be seen for a number of things such as market differentiator, commodity, tools, etc. Same goes
            for our other advancements for human conscious. Good example would be the Bronze-medieval period in which human
            society was making their own market differentiator such as farming, mining, ministry, military, etc. In which each
            field produces their own tools and commodity in which benefited the other sectors of human development that required
            other resources to further fuel their own market, in which further fuel other markets. This is simply a cycle  with
            multiple cycles adds more cycles to them, with each passing development for either technological or social advancement.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p class="imp1">
        If I have to say I would say IT in general is a mixture of both market differentiator and a commodity.
            <u>Reason for this is the following:</u>
            <br>
            <br>

            <b>IT</b> was used mostly for military use, especially during late WW2-Space Race/Cold War
         in which caused the market for IT to specialize in military use but required scientific advancement
         which in turn cause other industries to make more specialized products for scientific studies, in
         which will be used by the military for the space race & military advancement
         With each global power competing for dominance they helped spur a wide range of specialized fields that
         required them to be top over their competitors (aka capitalist vs communist)
         Eventually these advancements became a commodity and was used as tools to further help the educational community
         In which help spur new advancements in IT in which in turn cause more fields to be more specialized to
         handle the new information, such as cyber security, networking , A.I, computing power, etc

        <br>
        <br>
                <p class="imp1">
           In which caused the cycle to begin a new with better and (hopefully) more efficient designs
         Can go on and on IT & many other fields are both a market differentiator and a commodity it depends on who uses them and for what purpose.
        If you are a company that purchases x,y, and z program to work on a,b,c projects requested by e,f,i companies then you are working on a market differentiator,
            in which will be used by e,f,i companies that will use your projects for their agendas.Since you bought x,y, and z programs to work on e,f, i companies
            you just used a tool to accomplish your agendas (or goals). While e,f,i companies used your company to accomplish their goals, they picked your
            company because your able to provide a service that is different from your competitors. In some cases that might be price, political views, reputation,
            connections, etc.

        While in turn the a,b,c programs will be used for j,k,l projects that is required by the job specifications by e,f,i companies.
            All of this in turn comes back to the company that you bought the program from. By purchasing x,y, and z program you just helped
            give the company to further work on those programs by giving them the data that their products are being used for x,y purposes.

            </p>

                     <p class="imp1">
        This is just the business aspects of it, now looking at the everyday consumer that uses the published versions of j,k,l in
            which they use it for their own agendas, and its part of their tool set to work with. From this we can go on and on its a
            repeating cycle that constantly improves with each iteration. Each button clicked, page viewed, app opened, purchased, login,
            registration, saved doc, etc is all part of the process each coming back and forth from market differentiation to being used as
            a commodity/tool in which will spark new market deafferentation , in which in turn will make new tools available, and so on and on.

        In short

        IT in the general sense is important, its both how and why you use it, that counts. This anology goes for the same for the
            other advancements that our species has discovered / made over the past few thousands of years. Knowledge is built upon with
            years of iteration, with each passing year the human knowledge is forever increasing.</p>
