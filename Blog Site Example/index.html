        <h2>Importance of Data</h2>
        <p class="imp0">The survival of any type of organization requires data to function properly, without it they will be direction less
    and main goals obscured with individual agendas taking most control while leaving the bigger picture agenda for the
    whole group lacking focus. In order for it to be a successful operation, both agendas personal and bigger agenda must
    align or have similar focus/end goals . This requires data of both parties and including their target audience. That
    could be used for commercial, governmental, military,scientific, educational, etc.
        </p>

        <br>

<p class="imp1">
In which will be sub-categorized into smaller and more defined goals & objective requirements, such as civilian use,
        private security, public security, public so and so, private so and so, what is the reason for this? who will use
        it? what is the cost? How can we achieve this? What is the end result? How long will it take? Who will operate it?
        Who will etc & etc. This will further become more defined over time, as more data is acquired.
<br>
Anyhow the rest of the information in regarding to acquiring data can be found on here <a href="">Does IT Matter?</a>  In which will
        get into depth of the process & the continuous cycle of innovating new ways to do objectives more efficiently
        which in turn requires data.  Everything is connected no matter how small or insignificant it seems, everything
        action, information/data is important.
</p>

        <p class="imp1">
    All of this has a consequence and its solely up to the person or entity
        that has it uses it wisely, or else it will have a profound impact on themselves, their community,  the worldâ€™s
        history(past,current, and future), culture and political atmosphere.

Now knowing this knowledge for data and its many usage in the world of physical and digital plane, the question is how
        will you use it? And for what purpose? How far are you willing to go, and how much are you willing to risk it for?
        Sometimes its better to go in head first, while other times its best to observe from a distance , see the current
        results then act upon it. The choice is yours, and so is the world.</p>
