                                working on putting your own images as bullet points. Bug at the moment in which its
                                not showing. Will be fixing this issue, before continuing on the tutorial .

                            link for more css bullet point info: https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/l/list-style/

v24 Random Blog Post: made 2 new html files random_blog_quote & quote1. the first one has 'random' blog quotes the other
                        is a bit more organized. You can see the 'design' of it by comparing both of them. Hopefully this will
                        give you some ideas ^_*

v25 Static Site Layout: made a static_layout.html file which shows what a 'static' site looks like. short summary, its
                            not dynamic to the users screen size, so any changes to the 'orignal height/width' will probably
                            look messed up on the user end which doesnt have the same information as the master version.
                            Good way to fixed this is via dynamic web page.

                            * Thinking of taking snippets of the done version, and place their images onto the respo to give
                            a good understanding on what the finished version looks like after implementing the code onto
                            it.
 ----------------------------    ----------------------------   ------------------------- ------------------------------
v26 ITS ALIVE! Dynamic Site: new file called dyam_site.html now takes into the user's screen size and modify it self
                                according to its style9.css percentage and fits onto the user's dynamic screen. If the
                                user's screen size is small, the site will modify to fit that small screen size.
                                If the screen size is big, the screen will modify to fit that big screen size, etc,etc.

v27 Image CSS: made new file called image_css.html to show on how you can use an image with css implements. The background
                    is a bit 'ugly' but it shows the concept of using images with the aid of css/html.
