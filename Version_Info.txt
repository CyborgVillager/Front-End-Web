                        the both of them together.

                    Link to further CSS properties: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_font-style.asp

                hopefully this will be good enough to get anybody new to this get a good start! I really enjoy making / and seeing
                stuff like this grow, and put it to good use to further increase humanities understanding of code & tech!


v19 CSS Box & Update: further update v18 file, to include 'author name' and the choice to click on the author's name to
                            see the author's email if the user would like to get into contact with the author.
                            Besides that new file just to show css boxes
----------------------------    ----------------------------   ------------------------- ------------------------------
 v20 CSS Implement: new file html_box_css & style3 just shows on how css can implement a 'box' for certain information
                        from style3.css .


 v21 CSS Bullet Points <-x_x->: file bullet_pts.html , you can see on how to implement 'bullet points'. Currently
                                working on putting your own images as bullet points. Bug at the moment in which its
                                not showing. Will be fixing this issue, before continuing on the tutorial .

                            link for more css bullet point info: https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/l/list-style/


v22 Fixed Info |x_x|: fixed v21 CSS Bullet Points, now images can be shown as bullet points, with the correct info

v24 Random Blog Post: made 2 new html files random_blog_quote & quote1. the first one has 'random' blog quotes the other
                        is a bit more organized. You can see the 'design' of it by comparing both of them. Hopefully this will
                        give you some ideas ^_*

v25 Static Site Layout: made a static_layout.html file which shows what a 'static' site looks like. short summary, its
                            not dynamic to the users screen size, so any changes to the 'orignal height/width' will probably
                            look messed up on the user end which doesnt have the same information as the master version.
                            Good way to fixed this is via dynamic web page.

                            * Thinking of taking snippets of the done version, and place their images onto the respo to give
                            a good understanding on what the finished version looks like after implementing the code onto
                            it.
----------------------------    ----------------------------   ------------------------- ------------------------------
v26 ITS ALIVE! Dynamic Site: new file called dyam_site.html now takes into the user's screen size and modify it self
                                according to its style9.css percentage and fits onto the user's dynamic screen. If the
                                user's screen size is small, the site will modify to fit that small screen size.
                                If the screen size is big, the screen will modify to fit that big screen size, etc,etc.

v27 Image CSS: Made new file called image_css.html to show on how you can use an image with css implements. The background
                    is a bit 'ugly' but it shows the concept of using images with the aid of css/html.

                    * New image added to folder images -> tristhpyramid.JPG

v28 JS/JQuery Begin: will start on js/jquery tut, new folder will hold the new info.

v29 Greeting JS: Basic js greeting @ new folder js_and_jquery. js folder hold the js file time_greet.js. time_greet.html
                    has html info & style0.css has the css info. basic summary of using js to be used for a web-page.
                    made basic additions to the file to show some visual examples of combining, html->css and js together.

v30 React: Will get to work on putting some react tutorials, then build up to back end using python to give you a taste
                of full-stack dev.

                Its quite enjoyable making stuff like this. once this tut is complete will be making a 'template' that you
                can use as a reference on making a front-end site. Will be making a wiki for this respo to show the finished
                product for the site.

v31 Basic hello: Basic hello for hello.html , just tells the user hello once they load the webpage.

v32 MSG.html & let: Using let to declare a var/value. Besides that basic msg.html just tells the user hello & random
                        info alerts.

----------------------------    ----------------------------   ------------------------- ------------------------------
v33 Updated let/to do.html : Updated the outdated info for var time_greet.html & included new file for a const called basic_todo.js
                                that connects to basic_todo.html

v34 Forloop: New forloop statement.js & html file. Will be working on the react version now. If you would like to get a bit
                    more in-depth for JS then check this video out by Dev Ed for more info:
                    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZQc7RUAg18

v35 Testing Nav: testing nav by fireship that uses js & css, will modify/condise the code for better usage for future
                    projects. Good example & reference to use for future use.
                    Their video link for the responsive nav: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biOMz4puGt8&t=98s
                    They have some great content to learn / review from, would recommend if your planning to get a good
                    sense of coding or to get an idea if your still on the fence for IT dev.
                    -> original github code link: https://github.com/fireship-io/222-responsive-icon-nav-css
                    -> forked respo: https://github.com/CyborgVillager/222-responsive-icon-nav-css

                   Edit: As of now the custom updated navbar with comments will be in here, if I update the forked respo it will
                   be used for another reference. But as of now custom_nav.html & its other information will suffice enough.
                   Simplier is better espacially in the coding world

                        design/.html layout.

                        pretty much done at the moment, good reference to look at when making a front end site with
                        navigation using both css & js information.

v48 CSS Implement Grid: Aquired/modified info from respo: https://github.com/fireship-io/224-animated-css-grid for further animations
                        in css, to give 'user input'. Helps a lot espacially for mobile devices in which getting a feedback
                        from the system is important , sorta similiar to tactile feel.
                        Video tutorial on the respo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=705XCEruZFs made by Fireship.

                        Implemented the following:

                            /* Mobile Devices */
                            @media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
                            /* class* means to all class that is basic-grid, it will affect */
                              [class*="basic-grid"] {
                                margin: auto;
                                width: 90%;
                              }
                            }
                            on base.css for CSS/css/base.css that connects to basic_grid.html, this gives a bit more better
                            visual appeal for mobile users.
----------------------------    ----------------------------   ------------------------- ------------------------------
v49 Image Grid: modified Image grid, included new information to make it more accessible to potential posts, got an idea
                for using this reference for a special site in the making ^_*. Besides that mostly improved the concept/added
                new features

                Files that were changed :
                    * base.css
                    * style9.css
                    * img_grid.html
                    * Version_Info.txt

                    * animated-grid.css
                    * base.css
                    * footer.css
                    * img_grid.html
                    * Version_Info.txt

                Its been a blast working on this, quite an experience. I'll be working more on the react and be implementing it
                onto a couple of projects that I'm working on. Besides that feel free to use this respo for your reference
                as well! I'm all for sharing knowledge/increasing the collective understanding of code.

                Will be working on DB's to implement onto a site, and testing some things along the way, once that's complete
                will be working on react.

                                the background of their page, which will affect the other pages they go on in their system.

                             Special thanks to Fireship for the additional assitance -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuHGLzSmSE

                                Files Modified:
                                New file -> Web_Bck_Changer
                                    *index.html

                                    *img
                                        - logo.gif
                                    * css
                                        - styles.css
                                            - css info for the site
                                    *js
                                        -app0.js
                                            - Saves the user's 'data' of choice when they pick a color for the web page

                                Summary: Folder ->  Web_Bck_Changer is a good reference for the Django & Mezzanine project
                                            can implement for the user's end, and does not requires the user to register to have
                                               access to this feature. Besides that will work on improving this concept
                                               for future use

                                               Tested on 'mobile' side, works great will need to further improve the concept
                                               as stated before, however this is a good starting point from forward on.
